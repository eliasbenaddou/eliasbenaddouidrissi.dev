Hello, I'm Elias. I've been working in data roles for the past 4 years, starting as a Data Analyst in the credit reporting industry. After a couple years of working in data science, I enjoyed doing more programming and using software development best practices, which lead me to the role of Data Engineer. 

I have a First Class degree in Physics from Queen Mary University of London and I'm interested in personal finance, blockchain technology and learning programming languages.

I'm documenting my journey as a Data Engineer so that I can hopefully help others - you can subscribe to my Substack [Modern Data Engineering](https://eliasbenaddouidrissi.substack.com) where I will be writing as I'm learning.
