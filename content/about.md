I started working in data analytics in 2017 and transitioned into data engineering as the demand grew in the teams I worked with.

Over time, I learned from great mentors who emphasised the importance of doing things the right way—whether it’s following best practices for documentation, writing clean code, or applying thoughtful design patterns.

My [newsletter](https://moderndataengineer.substack.com) is my way of sharing these ideas and helping others grow in data engineering.

What you can expect:

Actionable advice for getting into data engineering - Clear, practical guidance to help you break into the field or take your skills to the next level.

Tools and frameworks to grow - From coding techniques to productivity workflows. Ideas to refine how you think, code, and build.

A mix of deep dives and quick reads: In-depth explorations of key topics alongside shorter, focused content.

I document my journey on my Substack [Modern Data Engineering](https://moderndataengineer.substack.com), sharing insights to hopefully help others in their data endeavors.
