My name is **Elias**. I'm a Data Engineer with five years of hands-on experience working with data.

I've worked in data roles within multiple industries, exploring new challenges and expanding my skill set. I'm currently working as a Data Engineer at the London Stock Exchange Group. 

I document my journey on my Substack [Modern Data Engineering](https://eliasbenaddouidrissi.substack.com), sharing insights to hopefully help others in their data endeavors.

I hold a first class degree in physics from Queen Mary University of London and some of the things that keep me busy are meal prepping, personal finance, building my second brain and learning programming languages.

Technologies I use: SQL • Python • AWS • GCP • Snowflake • Airflow • Kubernetes • Docker • Jenkins • Terraform • Notion
