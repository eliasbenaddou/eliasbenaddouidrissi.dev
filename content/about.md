Hello, I'm Elias. I've been working in data roles for the past 4 years, beginning as a data analyst in the credit reporting industry. I've worked with companies in the financial, ad-tech and retail sector on technical data sceince projects and I am currently a data engineer at the London Stock Exchange Group.

I hold a first class degree in physics from Queen Mary University of London and I'm interested in personal finance, blockchain technology and learning programming languages.

Technologies I use: SQL • Python • AWS • GCP • Snowflake • Airflow • Docker • Jenkins • Terraform • Notion

I'm documenting my journey so that I can hopefully help others - you can subscribe to my Substack [Modern Data Engineering](https://eliasbenaddouidrissi.substack.com) where i'll be writing as I'm learning.
